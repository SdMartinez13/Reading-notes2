**Chapter 5: "Images"(pp.94-125)**

- The `<img>` element is used to add images to a web page.

- You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.

- You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

**Chapter 11: "Color"(pp.246-263)**

- Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.

- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).

**Chapter 12: "Text"(pp.264-299)**

- There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.

- There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.

- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.

- You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.

- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.

**JPEG vs PNG vs GIF**

- JPEG is a lossy compression specification that takes advantage of human perception. It can achieve compression ratios of 1:10 without any perceivable difference in quality.

- PNG is a lossless image format using DEFLATE compression. No data is lost during compression and no compression artefacts are introduced in the image.

- GIF is also a lossless image format that uses LZW compression algorithm. It was favoured over PNG for simple graphics in websites in its early days because the support of PNG was still growing.  GIF images are now mainly used only if the image contains animations.
