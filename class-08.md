Readings: CSS Layout
===

***Learn CSS - Layout***

- **[link to reading](https://web.dev/learn/css/layout/)**
- The `display` property does two things. The first thing it does is determine if the box it is applied to acts as inline or block.
- Inline elements behave like words in a sentence
- elemnts such as `<span>` and `<strong>` are inline by default.
- Flexbox is a layout mechanism for one-dimensional layouts. Layout across a single axis, either horizontally or vertically.
- Grid is similar in a lot of ways to flexbox, but it is designed to control multi-axis layouts instead of single-axis layouts (vertical or horizontal space).
