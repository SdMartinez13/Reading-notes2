Readings: Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables
===

***Domain Modeling***
---

- process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem

- describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain

- An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

**Chapter 6:"Tables(pp.126-145)**

- `<table>` element is used to add tables to a web page
- tabvle is drawn out row by row, each row is created with the `<tr>` element
- inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the `<td>` element (ot the `<th>` element if its a header.
- you can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes)
- for long tables you can split the table into a `<thread>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.  

***Ducket JS Book***

**Chapter 3:"Functions, Methods, and objects"(pp.106-144)

- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
- Functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
